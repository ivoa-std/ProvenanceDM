\subsection{One processing step in PROV-N notation}
\TODO{Put the very simple example here}
See \url{https://volute.g-vo.org/svn/trunk/projects/dm/provenance/description/prov-example-incl-prototypes.txt}
and \url{https://volute.g-vo.org/svn/trunk/projects/dm/provenance/description/prov-example-w3c.txt}


\subsection{Provenance of RAVE database tables (DR4)}
This example shows how the workflow of RAVE data, from images to the final database tables, can be expressed using Provenance. 
The workflow is not included completely, only some major steps are taken into account. It shows that the provenance concepts explained in this draft can be applied directly to data obtained from astronomical observations.

\TODO{Include here figure from InterOp talk. See also https://provenance.ecs.soton.ac.uk/store/documents/84064/}
