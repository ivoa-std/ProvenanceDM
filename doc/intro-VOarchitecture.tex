\subsection{Role within the VO architecture}

The IVOA Provenance Data Model is structuring and adding metadata to trace the original process followed during the data production to provide astronomical data. Even if it borrows the main general concepts defined in the data management science, it binds to the specific context of astronomical metadata description and re-uses or interacts with existing IVOA models.
It takes benefits from existing IVOA notations and standards like UCD, VOUnits, VO protocols and service design and is planned for a full integration into the VO landscape.
