Provenance Data Model - Working Draft
======================================

What's what?
------------

* ProvDM.html -- the document source code.  This is what you
  should be editing.
* ProvDM-fmt.html -- the formatted document.  This will be overwritten, so
    DO NOT edit this.  To rebuild it, say "make" (provided you have the
    necessary dependencies, cf. below) or "make package".
* Makefile -- document date, version, and status are defined in there.
	This may also need some adaptation if your build environment is
  not a Debian wheezy (or Ubuntu 13.xx); a common target is "package".

See the comment at the top of Makefile for instructions on how to set up
things so they should work.



Working with the SVN Repository
===============================

Get the code
------------

Check-out the repository:

svn checkout --username volute@g-vo.org \
 https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/provenance/


Make use of "ivoadoc"
---------------------

(1) Have a look at:
http://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/ivoapub/ivoadoc/README

This file explains how to make use of "ivoadoc", a collection of scripts helping
with the authorship of IVOA documents, which are supposed to be delivered as
HTML (and PDF) files.


(2) In your working copy, give the command

svn propedit svn:externals \
 "ivoadoc https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/ivoapub/ivoadoc" .

followed by a

svn commit
svn update


(3) If your Makefile says

FOSTYLE=ivoadoc/ivoa-fo.xsl 

this file has to be edited for changing the layout of your PDF.

"ivoadoc/ivoa-fo.xsl" is the stylesheet which is used (in combination with the
"Xalan" XSLT transformer) to convert the XHTML document to XSL-FO (Extensible
Stylesheet Language Formatting Objects). In a second step, the XSL-FO document
is passed to the Apache FOP formatter ("FOP" refers to "Formatting Objects
Processor") that will generate a PDF output document.

These processing steps are specified in the Makefile of the "provenance"
directory.
