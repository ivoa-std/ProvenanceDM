\subsection{Changes from WD-ProvenanceDM-1.0-20180530}

\begin{itemize}
\item Separate core model (W3C only) and extended model (IVOA Provenance DM).
\item Add definitions for specialised entities, including all the description classes and parameters.
\item Add definitions for specialised relations.
\item Updated serialization of the description classes for web services.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Changes from WD-ProvenanceDM-1.0-20170921}

\begin{itemize}
\item Moved ProvDAL to separate document.
\item Moved ProvTAP section and full definition of VOTable serialisation to separate ProvTAP document.
\item Moved chapter 6 with use cases and ``How to use the data model'' to  separate Implementation Note \citep{std:ProvenanceImplementationNote}.
\item Moved section on links to other data model into appendix.
\item ParameterDescription: Added attributes \attribute{xtype} and \attribute{arraysize}.
\item Agent.roles: Removed ``PI'' alternative to ``coordinator''.
\item Use values of RightsType of DatasetDM, public, secure, proprietary, for \attribute{Entity.rights}.
\item Minor corrections in HiPS use case, Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-serialization-examples} and tables in TAP schema.
% and Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-prov-votable} (TAP SCHEMA).
\item Minor correction in role names for hadStep/hadMember relationship.
\item Modified text on Parameters
\item Rename 3.4 section to Serialization of description classes for web services
\item Modified text on W3C serialization
\item add \attribute{location} and \attribute{value} attributes to \class{Entity}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Changes from WD-ProvenanceDM-1.0-20161121}

\begin{itemize}
\item New appendix for PROV-VOTable/TAP SCHEMA tables added
\item Corrected and extended attribute tables and mapping tables for links with DatasetDM and SimDM.
\item Restructured Accessing provenance section by splitting it in two: Section~\ref{sec:serialisations} for explaining the different serialization formats and differences to W3C serializations, Section ``Accessing provenance information''%~\ref{sec:provaccess} 
for describing the access protocols ProvDAL and ProvTAP.
\item Removed discussion section, since now all the topics are addressed in the main text.
\item Added paragraph on how to use the model in Section 6. %~\ref{sec:usecases-implementations}.
\item Shortened serialization examples, partially moved them to appendix.
\item Added paragraph on VOSI interface.
\item Added a proposed serialization of description classes.
\item Modified text on the content of EntityDescription, now seen as Entity attributes known before the Entity instance exists.
\item Renamed Section 6
%~\ref{sec:usecases-implementations} 
to stress that it explains applications of the model (use cases); implementation details and code examples can be found in Implementation Note \citep{std:ProvenanceImplementationNote}.
\item Complete rewrite of the ProvDAL section in Section ``Accessing provenance information'';%~\ref{sec:access_protocols};
new parameters, new figure and examples added.
\item Added additional figure for entity-activity relations.
\item Moved the figure showing relations between Provenance.Agent and Dataset.Party into Section~\ref{sec:dmlinks}.
\item Extended the entity role examples in table \texttt{tab:entity-roles}.
\item Added links to provn and votable-serialization for HiPS-use case, added first part of provn as example in the HiPS-use case section.
\item More explanations on links to data models in Section~\ref{sec:dmlinks}, introduced subsections, added table with SimDM-mapping.
\item Moved detailed implementation section from appendix to a separate document (implementation note), shortened the use cases \& implementation section.
\item Attribute/class updates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Added attribute \emph{votype} to \class{Activity}, can be used for ActivityFlows
    \item Added attribute \emph{time} to \class{Used} and \class{WasGeneratedBy}
    \item Added optional attributes \emph{Entity.creationTime} and \emph{EntityDescription.category}
    \item Added optional attributes \emph{Parameter.min},  \emph{Parameter.max},  \emph{Parameter.options}
    \item Removed the obscore/dataset attributes from EntityDescription, since they are specific for observations only and are not applicable to configuration entities etc.
    \item Use voprov:type and voprov:role in Table~\ref{tab:agent-roles} with example agent roles, i.e. replaced prov:person by Individual and prov:organization by Organization.
    \item Renamed \emph{label} attribute to \emph{name} everywhere, for more consistency with SimDM naming scheme (\emph{label} is reserved there for SKOS labels).
    \item Renamed attribute \emph{Entity.access} to \emph{Entity.rights} for more consistency with DatasetDM etc.
    \item Avoid double-meaning of \emph{description} (as reference and free-text description) by renaming the free-text description to \emph{annotation}. Mark description-references with arrows in attribute tables.
    \item Applied similar naming scheme to \emph{Parameter} and \emph{ParameterDescription}-classes
    \item Renamed \emph{docuLink} to \emph{doculink}
    \item Corrected attribute names in Table~\ref{tab:datasetmapping}.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
