\subsection{Access protocols}
\label{sec:access_protocols}
We envision two possible access protocols:
\begin{itemize}
\item ProvDAL: retrieve provenance information based on given ID of a data entity or activity.
\item ProvTAP: allows detailed queries for provenance information, discovery of datasets based on e.g. code version.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ProvTAP}
% update from François / 2017 15/09
ProvTAP is a TAP service specialisation for delivering IVOA Provenance metadata. As any TAP service (reference to TAP) it is providing ADQL ``query responses'' made of a single table gathering columns selected from the various tables defined in the service TAP schema. By default this table is formatted as a VOTABLE. Other formats (json, tsv, etc...) could be added optionnaly.

The table and column definitions with their metadata (unit, ucd, utype, datatype, description) available in the TAP schema are exactly the ones defined in the PROV-VOTABLE mapping of the IVOA provenance data model (see table and column definition  and metadata in the Appendix). This is totally similar to what has been done in the RegTAP specification (reference) for mapping the VOresource datamodel.

Example of ADQL queries for ProvTAP are also given in the appendix

\TODO{We need more details here! Output of TAP service is NOT a PROV-VOTABLE by default!}

%\TODO{Do we need combined query possibilities, i.e. ask for ObsCore-fields and Provenance fields in one query? Or rather use a 2-step-process, decoupling them from each other?}


%\TODO{Also look at PROV-AQ from the W3C.}

\subsection{VOSI availability and capabilities}
According to the DALI specification for VO services \citep{std:DALI}, a provenance service implementing ProvDAL and/or ProvTAP must provide a VOSI availability interface as well as a capabilities interface with entries for ProvDAL and/or ProvTAP. The \texttt{standardId}s for these provenance interfaces are:

\begin{verbatim}
ivo://ivoa.net/std/ProvenanceDM#ProvDAL-1.0
ivo://ivoa.net/std/ProvenanceDM#ProvTAP-1.0
\end{verbatim}

The capability for a TAP service to support the Provenance DM is expressed by the dataModel element as :
\begin{verbatim}
<dataModel ivoid="ivo://ivoa.net/std/ProvenanceDM#core-1.0">ProvenanceDM-1.0</dataModel>
\end{verbatim}

For ProvTAP, the VOSI tables interface also needs to be provided.
