\TODO{Add details from the discussion in Paris, 14th April 2016. Fran√ßois and 
Mireille had some suggestions for possible ProvDAL and ProvTAP specifications.
\begin{itemize}
\item ProvDAL: retrieve provenance information based on given id of a dataEntity of activity
\item ProvTAP: allows detailed queries for provenance information, discovery of datasets based on 
e.g. code version.
\item Do we need combined query possibilities, i.e. ask for ObsCore-fields and Provenance fields
in one query? Or rather use a 2-step-process, decoupling them from each other?
\end{itemize}
}

\TODO{Also look at PROV-AQ from the W3C.}
