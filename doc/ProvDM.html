<div class="section"><h2><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>In this document, we discuss a draft for an IVOA standard data model for describing the
provenance of data. We focus here on observational data, since provenance for
simulated data is already covered by SimDM 
<cite>std:SimDM</cite>. This draft is at a very preliminary state and may change at any time.</p> 


<div class="section"><h3><a id="othermodels">Previous efforts on provenance modelling</a></h3>
<!-- There has been considerable work on provenance models, especially in other communities as  well. -->

<div class="subsection"><h4><a id="previvoaprov">Provenance in the IVOA</a> [TODO]</h4>
<p>
Provenance was already discussed since the early days of the IVOA, but previous efforts from the IVOA community unfortunately are mostly not well documented or we could not find it. 
There exists a vocabulary list by Arnold Rots, we got a provenance diagram from a talk by Francois Bonnarell, and there exists workflows to track provenance for specific projects (e.g. CTA), but this is all very specific and too detailed for the first steps. We therefore went a step back to start with a more abstract core model as discussed in this document.
</p>

<p>
<em>TODO: give more specific references, check other data models and where they touch provenance</em>
</p>
</div> <!-- subsubsection previvoaprov -->

<div class="subsection"><h4><a id="opmw3c">Open Provenance Model (OPM) and W3C PROV-DM</a></h4>
<p>
Other communities have put considerable efforts into establishing a provenance model.
The Provenance Challenge series (2006 - 2010) was a community effort to achieve inter-operability between different representations of provenance in scientific workflows. It resulted in the Open Provenance Model (<cite>OPM</cite>), and some members of that challenge continued their work by joining the W3C Provenance Working Group. The W3C Provenance Data Model was released as Recommendation in 2013. The cores of OPM and W3C are in principle the same, therefore we describe here briefly the basic concepts of the Provenance Data Model (PROV-DM, see <cite>std:W3CProvDM</cite>) by the W3C consortium in this section.
</p>

<p>OPM was designed to be applicable to anything, scientific data as well as cars or immaterial things like decisions. With W3C, this becomes more focused on the web. Nevertheless, the core concepts should be useful for astronomical data sets as well, though we can expect that it can be made more specific and less abstract for our purposes. 
</p>

<p>
The elements of a provenance model can be expressed as a directed graph to capture the causal dependencies. In W3C, there are three core components, i.e. nodes of the graph:
(see Section 1+2 and Fig. 1 in <cite>std:W3CProvDM</cite> for the detailed specification, which we reproduce here only partially):
</p>

<ul>
<li>Entity: a thing, at a certain state (car, paper, data set, idea)
</li><li>Activity: an action/process or series of actions, occurs over a period of time, performed on or caused by entities, usually results in new entities
</li><li>Agent: executes/controls an activity
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are also different possible relations between these components. Those important for astronomical data are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Generation: a new entitiy is generated by an activity (activity -> output data)
</li><li>Usage: an entity is used by an activity (activity -> input data)
</li><li>Association: agents have responsibility for an activity (agent -> activity)
</li>
</ul>



<p>
The W3C PROV-DM further specifies a derivation relation, which directly links a derived entity to its predecessor. This was introduced to make the link between entities more explicite. If activity A used entitites A1 and A2 as input and produced A3 as output, it is not clear, if A3 is a derivative (or, in OPM terms, "was generated from") A1 or A2 or both or neither. A1 and A2 could have been just parameter files for an observation.  

However, in this model we approach this problem differently by using a Method object that is used as a template for each activity. The types of input/output data and their roles are described using additional classes for the method, so that any kind of relation between input/output data can be covered by this. This will be explained in a later section.
</p>

<p>
One of the important details here is that e.g. many data sets used by one activity may have different roles for that process (one file is a parameter file, another one is the raw image, and the third one is the dark field that should be subtracted). Since these roles are very important for an activity, they have to be included in the provenance model.

These roles don't have to be unique (see <cite>OPM</cite>, after Definition 10), many data sets may have the same role for a process (e.g. raw image input).
The IVOA community should specify and describe the possible roles for each method (which is the template for the activity), in order to facilitate interoperability.
</p>

<p>
OPM also suggests to allow hierarchical descriptions, i.e. allow to include different ways of getting from data set A to data set B, with different levels of detail. 
This needs to be discussed further. 
(After talk at InterOp-Madrid, some people said that this would be important for them!)
</p>

<p>
W3C describes a collection as an aggregation of entities. This is a useful concept to adapt here, since it allows to treat many data (e.g. the RAVE survey) as one entity.
</p>

<p>
<em>TODO: more details about W3C; explain reasons, why the other relations (e.g. Communication) are not needed. Should we include specific agent-relations like attribution, delegation? </em>

<div class="section"><h2><a id="prov_dm">A Provenance Data Model</a></h2>

<div class="section"><h3><a id="requirements">Requirements for Provenance and Use Cases</a> [TODO: update this section!!]</h3>

<p>A provenance data model should provide solutions to the following tasks:
<ul class="nonestylelist">
	<li><strong>A: </strong>Recover steps of production.</li>
	<li><strong>B: </strong>Aid in figuring out which processing steps have 
		already been done.</li>
	<li><strong>C: </strong>Attribution.</li>
	<li><strong>D: </strong>Aid in debugging.</li>
	<li><strong>E: </strong>Quality assessment of an observation/reduction.</li>
	<li><strong>F: </strong>Search in structured provenance metadata.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>To give concrete examples, we formulate here some use cases derived from the
list of tasks given above:
<ul class="nonestylelist">
	<li><strong>A1: </strong>Is the image from catalogue xxx already calibrated?
What about dark field subtraction? Were foreground stars removed? Which technique
was used?</li>
	<li><strong>B1: </strong>Which pipeline version was used &#8211; the old one
with a known bug for treating bright objects or a newer version? <em>(similar to
A, isn't it?)</em></li>
	<li><strong>B2: </strong>Is the background noise of atmospheric muons
still present in my neutrino data sample?</li>
	<li><strong>C1: </strong>I want to use an image - who was involved in
creating it?</li>
	<li><strong>C2: </strong>I have a question about column xxx in the data
table. Who can I ask about that?</li>
	<li><strong>D1: </strong>I found something strange in an image. Where does
the image come from? Which instrument was used, with which characteristics
etc.? Was there noted anything strange when the image was taken?</li>
	<li><strong>D2: </strong>This light curve doesn't look quite right. How was
the photometry determined for each data point?</li>
	<li><strong>E1: </strong>Since wrong calibration images may increase the
number of atrifacts on an image rather than removing them, the knowledge about
the calibration image set will help to assess the quality of the calibrated
image.</li>
	<li><strong>F1: </strong>I want to know the complete history of my image,
where are the raw files located, which processing steps were done, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>F2: </strong>Give me more images that were produced using the
same pipeline.</li>
	<li><strong>F3: </strong>Give me an overview on all images reduced with the
same calibration data set.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class="section"><h3><a id="domain_model">A model for provenance</a></h3>
<p>We present here the core concepts for modelling provenance. The resulting model can be reused as a kind of pattern, everywhere where provenance is needed. (TODO: How exactly may be described here as well or even in the other data models.)</p> 

<p>
The class diagram generated with MagicDraw Community Edition is given in the following figure; the details are described in the next sections.</p>

<div class="figure" align="center">
<img src="ProvDM-classdiagram.png" width="80%" 
  alt="[The Provenance Data Model class diagram]"/>
<p class="figurecaption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The (current) Provenance Data Model
class diagram. It will certainly change again, so use it with care.</p>
</div>



<div class="section"><h4><a id="activity_method">Activity and method; relation to SimDM</a></h4>
<p>The provenance of simulation data is already covered within the SimDM data model <cite>std:SimDM</cite>, which is an IVOA recommendation since May 2013. In SimDM as well as in the Unified Domain Model, there are two central classes: Protocol and Experiment. A Protocol is the plan or method
which describes how to do something whereas Experiment is the actual execution of
this plan. Defining such protocols allows them to be reused, which is very useful when performing series of experiments of the same type, as is typically done in astronomy. 

Therefore, we adopt this approach here, but use the more generic term
&quot;Activity&quot; instead of Experiment, as it us used by the W3C Provenance Data Model (<cite>std:W3CProvDM</cite>). Instead of &quot;Protocol&quot;, we use the term &quot;Method&quot;, 
for not confusing it with e.g. IVOA protocols.</p>


<p>Examples for astronomical activities are observations and processing steps like
flat-fielding, correcting bias, astrometric calibration etc. The type or method
underlying an activity is specified by the corresponding <em>Method</em> class.
This could be, for instance, the name of the code used to perform an activity or a more general description. An activity is a concrete case of using such a method, thus it has to refer to a corresponding method. </p>

<p>
There MUST be exactly one method per activity. If steps from a pipeline shall be 
grouped together, one needs to create a proper method for describing all 
the steps at once. This method can then be refered by the pipeline-activity. 
</p>
</div> <!-- subsubsection activity_method -->


<div class="section"><h4><a id="data_desc">Data and DataDescription</a></h4>
<p>We define a general &quot;Data&quot; class (actually: DataComponent, see next section), 
which can represent either an individual data item or a collection of data. The W3C equivalent to this class is called &quot;Entity&quot;; we use  &quot;Data&quot; instead, since we do not aim to model cars and abstract ideas here, but more concretely astronomical data of any kind. 
</p>


<p>Following the scheme that each &quot;activity&quot; is described
by the more general &quot;method&quot;, we associate each input or
output data set with a corresponding description of the data type. Each method
usually makes assumptions on the structure of input data (FITS file, data
table, binary file of a certain structure ...) and produces a certain form of
output data, which should be described in the general &quot;DataDescription&quot;
class, so that it can be reused for multiple instances of this class.</p>


<p>There has been some dispute (before and at the InterOp in Madrid, 2014) about the different roles of input and output data. Since the results of one activity can be input data for
another activity, the structure of input and output data is necessarily the same.
The link from an &quot;Activity&quot; to the corresponding &quot;Data&quot;
object could tell then if the piece of data is used as input or output (see
figure at <span class="xref">links_between_data</span>).</p>

<p>However, input data can take different roles in an activity (auxiliary data like a parameter file, two images, with one that needs to be subtracted from the other) and it must be made explicit which data component that is used by or generated from an activity fulfills which role. In W3C, this is solved by adding a derivation relation between the entities (data). Here, we add a mapping-class between activity and data as well as between method and datadescription. The mapping-class at the description side, i.e. between the Method and its DataComponentDescriptions, contains additionally a role for each relation, e.g. parameter, dark frame, raw image, etc. </p>

<p><em>Note: Suggestion by Jochen: What about defining a Role-class for methods? This way each method should define the roles that are allowed for the method (probably taken from a specified list of vocabularies), enhancing inter-operability.</em></p>

<p><em>TODO: Do we really need to distinguish between input and output data? What about such things like ambient conditions, which can be considered as one or the other? Should this be covered by the roles? The original idea of the distinction was, that there is a bidirectional link between activity and output, but NOT between activity and input, since the input data does not necessarily need to know where it is used further on. However, as Jochen pointed out, transfering this to a relational database, the distinction is only one field in a database table, so we could just include it for both and have one common table for input and output relations.</em>
</p>



<p>Without the mapping tables, the relation between activity/method and data/datadescription would be an aggregation relation, or in other words: an association with the aggregationKind "shared". That would be required to ensure that all DataComponents linked to an activity (either as input or output) will survive if the activity is destroyed, since they are almost always shared with other activities.</p>




<!-- old text without mapping tables: 

<p>The aggregation relation from Activity to inputDataComponents is directed: the Activity needs
to have a list of all necessary input data (files, tables, parameters, images, ...), but the input
data should not have a reference forward to all the activities where they are used.
</p>

<p>The aggregation relation from Activity to resultDataComponents is not directed: 
here we need both directions: the Activity needs a result-list and all the 
resultDataComponents must know where they are coming from. 
This is the most important relation of the provenance data model, which allows  
to track the history of a DataComponent (together with the link between Activity and inputData). 
</p>
<p>Note that there is always exactly 1 activity that created the data or none. This is how we define it. If there are multiple activities involved for producing one result, then they have to be defined separately, possibly with temporary results in between. Or, alternatively, we define one big activity that is actually a combination of multiple steps, but the 
steps themselves are not defined further (i.e. they get no extra rows in a database representation of our model).  
</p>

-->

<p>
By using the mapping tables we can use a composition relation to the activity/method and simple associations to the individual data components and their descriptions. But as mentioned above, whether we need a clear distinction between input/output or not, is still to be discussed. 
</p>

 



</div> <!-- subsubsection data_desc -->


<div class="section"><h4><a id="data_sets">Data Collections - Composite pattern</a></h4>
<p>
There are two major data classes: 
</p>
<ul> 
<li>data collections <br/>e.g. RAVE-DR4 with its databases and database tables, SDSS DR9 with 
all its tables and files, all files from one observing slot<br/>
</li>
<li>individual data items<br/>
e.g. a file, table in a database, parameter value, an image, a fits-file containing a table and image
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Data can only be grouped to a data collection, if they have the same origin (i.e. they were
produced by the same activity, i.e. they have the same provenance).
We would leave it to the person/tool recording provenance to decide, how detailed a data set will be  
separated into individual items. It is also possible to just record provenance for e.g. RAVE DR4 as a 
whole, without listing everything that belongs to DR4. The level of detail could then be specified via 
the DataDescription.
</p>

<p>
For our data model, it would be desirable to be able to treat data collections and individual data items in
the same way, with the same interface. This demand led us to the 
<strong>Composite design pattern</strong>:
</p>
 
<p>
We introduce an abstract class called &quot;DataComponent&quot;, which 
includes the basic properties and functionality for both, data items like files or 
parameter values or a complete data set. Such common properties are e.g. the link 
to the activity which created the data/dataCollection, a creation date/time and a link to a
storage-object (which is not further specified in this data model).

Each DataComponent can either be a single item (like a file, database table or a parameter) 
or a DataSet. A DataCollection contains additionally a (non-empty) list of child-DataComponents, 
which could again contain a list of 
further children etc. This way, one could represent complete data trees, if necessary.

Each DataComponent also has a link to its parent, which would be 
emtpy (or point to itself) for the root-DataComponent.

We hope that such a representation would make it easier for clients to handle data 
objects, since they don't have to make the distinction between data items and data 
sets. 
</p>
</div> <!-- subsubsection data_set -->

<div class="section"><h4><a id="storage">Storage</a></h4>
<p>The modeling of storage is not included in this model. 
It would be useful to be able to make a reference from the DataComponent to a storage
object that contains the link to where the data is stored. But we haven't fixed the 
details here.
</p>
</div> <!-- subsubsection storage -->


<div class="section"><h4><a id="dataelements">Different data elements</a></h4>
<p>We divide DataComponents into three different types: 
<ul>
<li>TransientData: These are parameters that are not stored. E.g. a parameter given in the 
command line when starting a code. Or an output value that was printed in the terminal when 
a program was executed and is lost when the session is closed. A command-line input parameter
may be stored in the log-output file, but still one would want to define this as a transient
data element for specifying the input for the activity completely.
</li> 
<li>TemporaryData: This captured data that are produced during an Activity but are deleted again 
during the process. They could also just have lived in memory. It may be useful to record 
them in the provenance of the final data set anyway to get a clearer picture of 
the Activity steps involved.  
</li>
<li>StoredData: These are the "usual" data, stored as a file, in a database table; as an image, table,
binary file, template, ....
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
We had discussed making a distinction between "Parameters" and "Data". Parameters 
would come as key-value pairs and users would usually be interested in their 
values directly. "Data" would have meant everything else, i.e. data for which mainly 
the name and storage location would be important for the user.  We would not want to model each single
row of a table as one data item. However, during some discussions we came up with this 
distinction that hopefully is a better representation of the world of data.</p>

<p>If an Activity needs five parameters, the Method for this Activity needs to define if these
are expected to come as a parameter file (StoredData) or if they are to be entered 
on the command line (TransientData). </p>

<p>NOTE: So what if the Activity expects 5 parameters entered directly, but I create an input file
and pipe it into the Activity? Then this input file would contain the TransientData and 
they would be StoredData instead.
</p>

</div> <!-- subsubsection dataelements -->


<div class="section"><h4><a id="links_between_data">Links Between Data</a></h4>
<p>It would be convenient if each data object or even each file (&quot;Storage&quot; object)
gets a unique &quot;dataId&quot; that can be referenced. If several copies have been
made out of a data set and one of them is corrupted, it would even be useful to know
exactly which copy was used by a given activity.</p>

<p><em>Maybe DataLink can help here?</em></p>

<p>We need to be able to refer from an activity to the ResultData of another
activity. A possible data flow is shown in the figure below:</p>

<div class="figure" align="center">
<img src="ProvDM-activities.png" width="45%" 
  alt="[Example for activities]"/>
<p class="figurecaption"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The black arrows indicate the
data flow, gray arrows just show which activity would be attached to the step. It
is defined by the key in the corresponding Activity whether data is used as input
or output.</p>
</div>

</div> <!-- subsubsection links_between_data -->

<div class="section"><h4><a id="calib_data">Calibration data</a></h4>
<p>The calibration data set consists of images that can be used to calibrate the
raw data. It is not necessary to mention them explicitly in the model. Instead
they can be included by adding an activity called &quot;Calibration&quot;:
<ul>
	<li>Activity: Calibration (status: planned or finished)</li>
	<li>InputData: uncalibrated image, calibration data set</li>
	<li>ResultData: null or calibrated data</li>
	<li>Agent: null or name</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If the calibration has not yet been done, the calibration activity would still
need to be described to make sure that the calibration data sets and links to the
uncalibrated data will be recorded. In that case, the calibration activity would
have the status &quot;planned&quot; or similar and we would have null results.
</p>

<p>Basically, the calibration data could also be recorded as the result of the
activity &quot;Generating calibration data&quot;, but it is not required to
include this into our model. However, the link between input data and their
calibration data sets is needed and could be established via the Calibration
activity as suggested here.

<div class="section"><h4><a id="ambient_conditions">Ambient Conditions</a></h4>
<p>
Ambient conditions are environmental properties, which are special in a way: 
they represent the part of an activity, usually an observation, which cannot be 
(fully) controlled by an
observer, in contrast to other data that can be fully reproduced.
Nevertheless we now decided that they can be fully described by our 
data classes. Thus they are not forming a separate class in our data model, but should 
be treated as just another input data set. 
</p>

<p>Our model can then also take into account that a certain observation
method requires special ambient conditions, already defined via the method
(e.g. radio observations rely on different ambient conditions than observations
of gamma rays), just following our data - data description scheme.
</p>

<p>Ambient conditions are recorded for a certain time (executionDate) and are
usually only valid for a certain time interval. This time interval should be recorded
with the validity-attribute for DataComponents.
</p>

<p><em>We wondered if ambient conditions could also play a role for some
processing steps or any other activity besides observations? Is there any
additional step performed in which room temperature etc. may play a role and thus
should be recorded? The only example that came to our minds was the storage of
photographic plates, where the humidity and temperature variations can affect the
quality of the photographic plates.</em></p>

</div> <!-- subsubsection ambient_conditions -->

<div class="section"><h4><a id="instrument_characs"
>Instrument Characteristics</a></h4>
<p>In contrast to the ambient conditions, instrument characteristics do not
change from one observation to the other, so they are static, strictly related to
the instrument. 
All the characteristics could be described either as key-value pairs directly with the 
observation or just as data, using the DataComponent class. One would then 
link the instrument characteristics as a type of input data set to a certain 
observation activity. Thus we don't need a separate Instrument or Device class.
</p>

<p>
One should also keep in mind that some instrument related parameters can change within time,
e.g. the CCD temperature. These should probably rather go into ambient conditions.
Instruments can also change within time because of aging.
</p>

</div> <!-- subsubsection instrument_characs -->

<div class="section"><h4><a id="quality">Quality</a></h4>
<p>Here we could simply define additional attributes for each &quot;Activity&quot;
or &quot;Data&quot; object, i.e. zero, one, or more properties in the form of
key-value pairs. We could use a &quot;Quality&quot; namespace to mark a keyword
as quality-related:
<ul>
	<li>quality.comment: [some text]</li>
	<li>quality.seeing: [some value]</li>
</ul>
The values could range from a float number to free text.</p>
</div> <!-- subsubsection quality -->

<div class="section"><h4><a id="agent">Agent</a></h4>
<p>In SimDM, someone performing a certain experiment is called &quot;Contact&quot;, 
the W3C provenance data model suggests the term &quot;Agent&quot;. We want to 
describe here someone who is responsible for an activity, e.g. who pressed a button, 
ran a script or performed the observation. The agent could be a single person 
(specified by name), a group of persons (e.g. MUSE WISE Team) or a project (RAVE). 
For each of them a name needs to be specified.
</p>
<p>
It is desired to have an agent given for each activity, but it
is not enforced (hence 0..*).  It would also increase the value of the given
information if the (current) affiliation of the agent and a project leader/group
leader were specified in order to maximize the chance of finding someone later
on. But the agent should not only be used for getting contact information, but also 
to fulfill our "Attribution" requirement, so that proper credit goes to the right 
people/projects.
</p>

<em>NOTE: Use "Contact" instead of "Agent" to make it clearer that 
a person or project is meant, not a piece of code (like the "TargetProcessor" for MUSE)?</em>

<em>TODO: Specify contact or agent roles (see SimDM: owner, creator, publisher, contributer; any more?)</em>

</div> <!-- subsubsection agent -->

<div class="section"><h4><a id="project">Project</a></h4>
<p>To each Activity one can assign a Project that is responsible for the Activity. 
One may also specify a projectLeader, who is an Agent with name and maybe even contact details provided
for further reference.
