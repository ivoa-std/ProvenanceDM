<div class="section"><h2><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>In this document, we describe a draft for an IVOA standard data model for describing the
provenance of data. We focus here on observational data, since provenance for
simulated data is already (at least partially) covered by SimDM 
<cite>std:SimDM</cite>.</p>

<div class="section"><h2><a id="prov_dm">A Provenance Data Model</a></h2>

<div class="section"><h3><a id="requirements">Requirements for Provenance and Use Cases</a></h3>

<p>A provenance data model should provide solutions to the following tasks:
<ul class="nonestylelist">
	<li><strong>A: </strong>Steps of production.</li>
	<li><strong>B: </strong>Aid in figuring out which processing steps have
already been done.</li>
	<li><strong>C: </strong>Attribution.</li>
	<li><strong>D: </strong>Aid in debugging.</li>
	<li><strong>E: </strong>Quality assessment of an observation/reduction.</li>
	<li><strong>F: </strong>Search in structured provenance metadata.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>To give concrete examples, we formulate here some use cases derived from the
list of tasks given above:
<ul class="nonestylelist">
	<li><strong>A1: </strong>Is the image from catalogue xxx already calibrated?
What about dark field subtraction? Were foreground stars removed? Which technique
was used?</li>
	<li><strong>B1: </strong>Which pipeline version was used &#8211; the old one
with a known bug for treating bright objects or a newer version? <em>(similar to
A, isn't it?)</em></li>
	<li><strong>B2: </strong>Is the background noise of atmospheric muons
still present in my neutrino data sample?</li>
	<li><strong>C1: </strong>I want to use an image - who was involved in
creating it?</li>
	<li><strong>C2: </strong>I have a question about column xxx in the data
table. Whom can I ask about that?</li>
	<li><strong>D1: </strong>I found something strange in an image. Where does
the image come from? Which instrument was used, with which characteristics
etc.? Was there noted anything strange when the image was taken?</li>
	<li><strong>D2: </strong>This light curve doesn't look quite right. How was
the photometry determined for each data point?</li>
	<li><strong>E1: </strong>Since wrong calibration images may increase the
number of atrifacts on an image rather than removing them, the knowledge about
the calibration image set will help to assess the quality of the calibrated
image.</li>
	<li><strong>F1: </strong>I want to know the complete history of my image,
where are the raw files located, which processing steps were done, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>F2: </strong>Give me more images that were produced using the
same pipeline.</li>
	<li><strong>F3: </strong>Give me an overview on all images reduced with the
same calibration data set.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class="section"><h3><a id="domain_model">Domain model for provenance</a></h3>
<p>In order to model provenance, we started with the SimDM data model, which
already includes the provenance for simulation data.</p>

<p>In SimDM and the Unified Domain Model, the two central classes are called
&quot;Experiment&quot; and &quot;Protocol&quot;. Protocol is the plan or method
which describes how to do something whereas Experiment is the actual execution of
this plan. We decided to rename &quot;Experiment&quot; to the more generic term
&quot;Activity&quot; used by the provenance model of the W3C consortium
<cite>std:W3CProvDM</cite>. Instead of &quot;Protocol&quot;, we use the term &quot;Method&quot;, for not confusing it with e.g. IVOA protocols.</p>

<div class="figure" align="center">
<img src="ProvDM-classdiagram.png" width="80%" 
  alt="[The Provenance Data Model class diagram]"/>
<p class="figurecaption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The Provenance Data Model
class diagram.</p>
</div>

<p>Examples for &quot;Activities&quot; are observations and processing steps like
flat-fielding, correcting bias, astrometric calibration etc. The type or method
underlying an activity is specified by the &quot;Method&quot; class.
This could be, for instance, the name of the code used to run an experiment or,
generally speaking, to perform an activity. The two sub-classes of
&quot;Activity&quot; are mirrored by sub-classes of
&quot;Method&quot;: &quot;Processing&quot; is described by a
&quot;Processor&quot;, an &quot;Observation&quot; is illustrated by the
&quot;ObservationMethod&quot; class.</p>

<p><em>A clearer definiton of method or protocol, some more clarification
what it is and what it is not, would be useful here.</em></p>

<p><em>Should also add that links between data/activities should go backwards (in time) only.</em></p>


<div class="section"><h4><a id="data_desc">Data and DataDescription</a></h4>
<p>We define a general &quot;Data&quot; class (actually: DataComponent, see next section), 
which can represent either input
or output/result data. Since the results of one activity can be input data for
another activity, the structure of input and output data is necessarily the same.
The link from an &quot;Activity&quot; to the corresponding &quot;Data&quot;
object would tell then if the piece of data is used as input or output (see
figure at <span class="xref">links_between_data</span>).</p>

<p>Following the scheme that each &quot;Activity&quot; is described
by the more general &quot;Method&quot;, we associate each input or
output data set with a corresponding description of the data type. Each activity
usually makes assumptions on the structure of input data (FITS file, data
table, binary file of a certain structure ...) and produces a certain form of
output data, which should be described in the general &quot;DataDescription&quot;
class, so that it can be reused for multiple instances of this class.</p>
</div> <!-- subsubsection data_desc -->


<div class="section"><h4><a id="data_sets">Data sets - Composite pattern</a></h4>
<p>
There are two major data classes: 
</p>
<ul> 
<li>data sets <br/>e.g. RAVE-DR4 with its databases and database tables, SDSS DR9 with 
all its tables and files, all files from one observing slot<br/>
</li>
<li>individual data items<br/>
e.g. a file, table, parameter value
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Data can only be grouped to a data set, if they have the same origin (i.e. they were
produced by the same activity, i.e. they have the same provenance).
We would leave it to the person/tool recording provenance to decide, how detailed a data set will be  
separated into individual items. It is also possible to just record provenance for e.g. RAVE DR4 as a 
whole, without listing everything that belongs to DR4.
</p>

<p>
For our data model, it would be desirable to be able to treat data sets and individual data items in
the same way, with the same interface. This demand led us to the 
<strong>Composite design pattern</strong>:
</p>
 
<p>
We introduce an abstract class called &quot;DataComponent&quot;, which 
includes the basic properties and functionality for both, data items like files or 
parameter values or a complete data set. Such common properties are e.g. the link 
to the activity which created the data/dataSet, a creation date/time, a link to a
storage-object (which is not further specified in this data model).

Each DataComponent can either be a single item (like a file, table or a parameter) 
or a DataSet. A DataSet contains additionally a (non-empty) list of child-DataComponents, 
which could again contain a list of 
further children etc. This way, one could represent complete data trees, if necessary.

Each DataComponent also has a link to its parent, which would be 
emtpy (or point to itself) for the root-DataComponent.

We hope that such a representation would make it easier for clients to handle data 
objects, since they don't have to make the distinction between data items and data 
sets. 
</p>
</div> <!-- subsubsection data_set -->

<div class="section"><h4><a id="storage">Storage</a></h4>
<p>If there exist other copies of the data, it would be useful to include a link
here, indicated by (multiple) association(s) from &quot;Storage&quot; to the
copies. We also need a link from the copies back to the Storage (bidirectional
association), so that it becomes immediately clear to which data the copy
belongs. The Storage itself (the &quot;original&quot; object) would be the one
that was actually used or produced by the activity. </p>
</div> <!-- subsubsection storage -->


<div class="section"><h4><a id="params_strucdata">Parameters and Structured 
Data</a></h4>
<p>We divide DataComponents that are not DataSets into &quot;Parameter&quot; and &quot;StructuredData&quot;.
The &quot;StructuredData&quot; class is represented by data that comes, for
example, in the form of a table or a structured binary file, where multiple data
points are collected in a structured way. We would not want to model each single
row of a table as one data item or data set.</p>

<p>Parameters are somehow different entities: usually we have here a pair of keys and
values, which may be stored in a log file or a parameter file, in the header of
an output file or inside a published article.</p>

<p>The main difference is probably what someone would be interested in: for
&quot;Parameter&quot;, one usually wants to know the value whereas for
&quot;StructuredData&quot;, the more relevant information is the file location.
</p>
</div> <!-- subsubsection params_strucdata -->


<div class="section"><h4><a id="links_between_data">Links Between Data</a></h4>
<p>It would be
convenient if each data object or even each file (&quot;Storage&quot; object)
would get a unique &quot;dataId&quot; that can be referenced. If several copies have been
made out of a data set and one of them is corrupted, it is relevant to know
exactly which copy was used by a given activity.</p>

<p><em>Maybe DataLink can help here?</em></p>

<p>We need to be able to refer from an activity to the ResultData of another
activity. A possible data flow is shown in the figure below:</p>

<div class="figure" align="center">
<img src="ProvDM-activities.png" width="45%" 
  alt="[Example for activities]"/>
<p class="figurecaption"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The black arrows indicate the
data flow, gray arrows just show which activity would be attached to the step. It
is defined by the key in the corresponding Activity whether data is used as input
or output.</p>
</div>

</div> <!-- subsubsection links_between_data -->

<div class="section"><h4><a id="calib_data">Calibration Data</a></h4>
<p>The calibration data set consists of images that can be used to calibrate the
raw data. It is not necessary to mention them explicitly in the model. Instead
they can be included by adding an activity called &quot;Calibration&quot;:
<ul>
	<li>Activity: Calibration (status: planned or finished)</li>
	<li>InputData: uncalibrated image, calibration data set</li>
	<li>ResultData: null or calibrated data</li>
	<li>Agent: null or name</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If the calibration has not yet been done, the calibration activity would still
need to be described to make sure that the calibration data sets and links to the
uncalibrated data will be recorded. In that case, the calibration activity would
have the status &quot;planned&quot; or similar and we would have null results.
</p>

<p>Basically, the calibration data could also be recorded as the result of the
activity &quot;Generating calibration data&quot;, but it is not required to
include this into our model. However, the link between input data and their
calibration data sets is needed and could be established via the Calibration
activity as suggested here.
</p>
</div> <!-- subsubsection calib_data -->

<div class="section"><h4><a id="ambient_conditions">Ambient Conditions</a></h4>
<p>
Ambient conditions are environmental properties, which are special in a way: 
they represent the part of an
&quot;experiment&quot; (observation) which cannot be (fully) controlled by an
experimentalist, in contrast to other data that can be fully reproduced.
Nevertheless we now decided that they can be fully described by our 
data classes. Thus they are not forming a separate class in our data model, but should 
be treated as just another input data set. 
</p>

<p>Our model could then also take into account that a certain observation
method requires special ambient conditions, already defined via the method
(e.g. radio observations rely on different ambient conditions than observations
of gamma rays), just following our data - data description scheme.
</p>

<p><em>We wondered if ambient conditions could also play a role for some
processing steps or any other activity besides observations? Is there any
additional step performed in which room temperature etc. may play a role and thus
should be recorded? The only example we could think of was the storage of
photographic plates, where the humidity and temperature variations can affect the
quality of the photographic plates.</em></p>

</div> <!-- subsubsection ambient_conditions -->

<div class="section"><h4><a id="instrument_characs"
>Instrument Characteristics</a></h4>
<p>In contrast to the ambient conditions, instrument characteristics do not
change from one observation to the other, so they are static, strictly related to
the instrument. 
All the characteristics could be described either as key-value pairs directly with the 
observation or just as data, using the DataComponent class. One would then 
link the instrument characteristics as a type of input data set to a certain 
observation activity. Thus we don't need a separate Instrument or Device class.
</p>

<p>
One should also keep in mind that some instrument related parameters can change within time,
e.g. the CCD temperature. These should probably rather go into ambient conditions.
Instruments can also change within time because of aging.
</p>

</div> <!-- subsubsection instrument_characs -->

<div class="section"><h4><a id="quality">Quality</a></h4>
<p>Here we could simply define additional attributes for each &quot;Activity&quot;
or &quot;Data&quot; object, i.e. zero, one, or more properties in the form of
key-value pairs. We could use a &quot;Quality&quot; namespace to mark a keyword
as quality-related:
<ul>
	<li>quality.comment: [some text]</li>
	<li>quality.seeing: [some value]</li>
</ul>
The values could range from a float number to free text.</p>
</div> <!-- subsubsection quality -->

<div class="section"><h4><a id="agent">Agent</a></h4>
<p>In SimDM, someone performing a certain experiment is called &quot;Party&quot;.
However, the W3C provenance data model suggests the term &quot;Agent&quot; which
we adopted here. It is desired to have an agent given for each activity, but it
is not enforced (hence 0..*).  It would also increase the value of the given
information if the (current) affiliation of the agent and a project leader/group
leader were specified in order to maximize the chance of finding someone later
on. <em>(Note: we could also use the term &quot;Contact&quot; here.)</em></p>
