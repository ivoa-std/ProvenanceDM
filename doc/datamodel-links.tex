%In this section we discuss how the Provenance Data Model interacts with
%classes and attributes from other VO data models (especially DatasetDM).
%(e.g. DatasetDM, SpectralDM (share some same classes), SimDM) 
%and how provenance information can be stored.

The Provenance Data Model can be applied without making links to any other 
IVOA data model classes. For example when the data is not yet published, provenance information
can be stored already, but a DatasetDM-description for the data may not yet exist.
But if there are data models implemented for the datasets, then it is 
very useful to connect the classes and attributes of the different models, 
which we are going to discuss in this Section. These links help to avoid 
unnecessary repetitions in the metadata of datsets, and also offer the possibility 
to derive some basic provenance information from existing data model classes automatically.


\subsection{Links with Dataset/Obscore Model}
Entities and their descriptions in the Provenance Data Model 
are tightly linked to the \class{DataSet}-class in the DatasetDM/ObsCore Data Model, as well as to 
InputDataset and OutputDataSet in the Simulation Data Model \citep[SimDM,][]{std:SimDM}.
Table \ref{tab:datasetmapping} maps classes and attributes from the Dataset Data Model 
to concepts in the Provenance Data Model.

The \class{Agent} class, which is used for defining responsible persons and 
organizations, is similar to the \class{Party} class in the Dataset Metadata Model and SimDM.

\subsection{Links with Simulation Data Model}
In SimDM one also encounters a normalization similar to our split-up of descriptions from 
actual data instances and executions of processes: the SimDM class ``experiment'' 
is a type of \class{Activity} and its general, reusable description is called a ``protocol'',
which can be considered as a type of this model's \class{ActivityDescription}. 
More direct mappings between classes and attributes of both models are given in Table~\ref{tab:simdmmapping}.
