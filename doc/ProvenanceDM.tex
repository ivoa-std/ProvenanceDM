\begin{abstract}
This document describes how provenance information for astronomical datasets 
%(with the focus on observational data) 
can be modeled, stored and exchanged within 
the astronomical community in a standardized way.
We follow the definition of provenance as proposed by the W3C\footnote{\url{https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/}}, i.e. that provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness.
Such provenance information in astronomy is important to enable any scientist to trace back
the origin of a dataset (e.g. an image, spectrum, catalog or single points in a 
spectral energy distribution diagram or a light curve), learn about the people and 
organizations involved in a project and assess the quality of the dataset as well
as the usefulness of the dataset for her own scientific work.

\section{Changes from Previous Versions}
% No previous versions yet.
% these would be subsections "Changes from v. WD-..."
% Use itemize environments.
\subsection{Changes from WD-ProvenanceDM-1.0-20161121}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use parameters \texttt{BACKWARD} and \texttt{FORWARD} instead of \texttt{STEP} in ProvDAL, Section~\ref{sec:access_protocols}.
\item Expanded Section~\ref{sec:access_protocols} on access protocols, especially ProvDAL part.
\item Moved the figure showing relations between Provenance.Agent and Dataset.Party into Section~\ref{sec:dmlinks}.
\item Added serialisation examples to Section~\ref{sec:serialisations}, voprov-implementation example to Section~\ref{sec:usecases-implementations}.
\item Use voprov:type and voprov:role in Table~\ref{tab:agent-roles} with example agent roles, i.e. replaced prov:person by Individual and prov:organization by Organization.
\item Removed the obscore/dataset attributes from EntityDescription, since they are specific for observations only and are not applicable to configuration entities etc.
\item Renamed \emph{label} attribute to \emph{name} everywhere, for more consistency with SimDM naming scheme (\emph{label} is reserved there for SKOS labels).
\item Extended the entity role examples in table \ref{tab:entity-roles}.
\item Renamed attribute \emph{Entity.access} to \emph{Entity.rights} for more consistency with DatasetDM etc.
\item Moved detailed implementation section from appendix to a separate document (implementation note), shortened the use cases \& implementation section.
\item Removed description\_ref as attribute, since it's expressed by the corresponding link in the model anyway.
\item More explanations on links to data models in Section~\ref{sec:dmlinks}.
\item Introduced subsections for Section~\ref{sec:dmlinks}, added table with SimDM-links.
\item Renamed \emph{docuLink} to \emph{doculink}
\item Avoid double-meaning of \emph{description} by splitting it up into: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{description\_ref}: a foreign key, reference to a description class 
(which could be located at an url as well)
    \item \emph{annotation}: free text description
    \end{itemize}
\item Applied similar naming scheme to \emph{Parameter} and \emph{ParameterDescription}-classes
\item Renamed Section~\ref{sec:usecases-implementations} to stress that it deals with implementations.
\item Added links to provn and votable-serialization for HiPS-use case, added first part of provn as example in the HiPS-use case section.
\item Corrected attribute names in Table~\ref{tab:datasetmapping}.

\end{itemize}


% \section{Implementation details}\label{sec:implementation-details}
% In this section we will give more details on the classes and attributes which were used 
% in implementations for each use case. This maybe needs to go into a different document, so it can 
% be updated without affecting this standard.

% TBD.
