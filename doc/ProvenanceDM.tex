This document describes how provenance information for astronomical datasets 
%(with the focus on observational data) 
can be modeled, stored and exchanged within 
the astronomical community in a standardized way.
We follow the definition of provenance as proposed by the W3C (see \url{https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/}), i.e. that provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness.
Such provenance information in astronomy is important to enable any scientist to trace back
the origin of a dataset (e.g. an image, spectrum, catalog or single points in a 
spectral energy distribution diagram or a light curve), learn about the people and 
organizations involved in a project and assess the quality of the dataset as well
as the usefulness of the dataset for her own scientific work.

%\section{Applying provenance -- Interactions with other Data models}\label{sec:dmlinks}
\section{Links to other data models}\label{sec:dmlinks}
In this section we discuss how the Provenance Data Model interacts with
other VO data models (especially DatasetDM).
%(e.g. DatasetDM, SpectralDM (share some same classes), SimDM) 
%and how provenance information can be stored.
Entities and their descriptions in the Provenance Data Model 
are tightly linked to the \class{DataSet}-class in the DatasetDM/ObsCore Data Model, as well as to 
InputDataset and OutputDataSet in the Simulation Data Model \citep[SimDM,][]{std:SimDM}.
Table \ref{tab:datasetmapping} maps classes and attributes from the Dataset Data Model 
to concepts in the Provenance Data Model.

\end{table}


The \class{Agent} class, which is used for defining responsible persons and 
organizations, is similar to the \class{Party} class in the Dataset Metadata Model and SimDM.
In SimDM one also encounters a normalization similar to our split-up of descriptions from 
actual data instances and executions of processes: the SimDM class ``experiment'' 
is a type of \class{Activity} and its general, reusable description is called a ``protocol'',
which can be considered as a type of this model's \class{ActivityDescription}.

More similarities and links to other data models will be detailed in future 
versions of this working draft.
