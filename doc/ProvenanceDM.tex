\begin{abstract}
This document describes how provenance information for astronomical datasets 
%(with the focus on observational data) 
can be modeled, stored and exchanged within 
the astronomical community in a standardized way.
We follow the definition of provenance as proposed by the W3C\footnote{\url{https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/}}, i.e. that provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness.
Such provenance information in astronomy is important to enable any scientist to trace back
the origin of a dataset (e.g. an image, spectrum, catalog or single points in a 
spectral energy distribution diagram or a light curve), learn about the people and 
organizations involved in a project and assess the quality of the dataset as well
as the usefulness of the dataset for her own scientific work.

\section{The provenance data model}
\input{datamodel-description}


%\section{Applying provenance -- Interactions with other Data models}\label{sec:dmlinks}
\section{Links to other data models}\label{sec:dmlinks}
%In this section we discuss how the Provenance Data Model interacts with
%classes and attributes from other VO data models (especially DatasetDM).
%(e.g. DatasetDM, SpectralDM (share some same classes), SimDM) 
%and how provenance information can be stored.

The Provenance Data Model can be applied without making links to any other 
IVOA data model classes. For example when the data is not yet published, provenance information
can be stored already, but a DatasetDM-description for the data may not yet exist.
But if there are data models implemented for the datasets, then it is 
very useful to connect the classes and attributes of the different models, 
which we are going to discuss in this Section. These links help to avoid 
unnecessary repetitions in the metadata of datsets, and also offer the possibility 
to derive some basic provenance information from existing data model classes automatically.


\subsection{Links with Dataset/Obscore Model}
Entities and their descriptions in the Provenance Data Model 
are tightly linked to the \class{DataSet}-class in the DatasetDM/ObsCore Data Model, as well as to 
InputDataset and OutputDataSet in the Simulation Data Model \citep[SimDM,][]{std:SimDM}.
Table \ref{tab:datasetmapping} maps classes and attributes from the Dataset Data Model 
to concepts in the Provenance Data Model.

\end{table}


The \class{Agent} class, which is used for defining responsible persons and 
organizations, is similar to the \class{Party} class in the Dataset Metadata Model and SimDM.

\subsection{Links with Simulation Data Model}
In SimDM one also encounters a normalization similar to our split-up of descriptions from 
actual data instances and executions of processes: the SimDM class ``experiment'' 
is a type of \class{Activity} and its general, reusable description is called a ``protocol'',
which can be considered as a type of this model's \class{ActivityDescription}. 
More direct mappings between classes and attributes of both models are given in Table~\ref{tab:simdmmapping}.

\section{Changes from Previous Versions}
% No previous versions yet.
% these would be subsections "Changes from v. WD-..."
% Use itemize environments.
\subsection{Changes from WD-ProvenanceDM-1.0-20161121}
\begin{itemize}
\item Removed description\_ref as attribute, since it's expressed by the corresponding link in the model anyway.
\item More explanations on links to data models in Section~\ref{sec:dmlinks}.
\item Introduced subsections for Section~\ref{sec:dmlinks}, added table with SimDM-links.
\item Renamed \emph{docuLink} to \emph{doculink}
\item Avoid double-meaning of \emph{description} by splitting it up into: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{description\_ref}: a foreign key, reference to a description class 
(which could be located at an url as well)
    \item \emph{annotation}: free text description
    \end{itemize}
\item Applied similar naming scheme to \emph{Parameter} and \emph{ParameterDescription}-classes
\item Renamed \emph{Agent.name} to \emph{Agent.label}, so that each class has an id and a label.
\item Renamed Section~\ref{sec:usecases-implementations} to stress that it deals with implementations.
\item Added links to provn and votable-serialization for HiPS-use case, added first part of provn as example in the HiPS-use case section.
\item Corrected attribute names in Table~\ref{tab:datasetmapping}.

\end{itemize}


\section{Implementation details}\label{sec:implementation-details}
In this section we will give more details on the classes and attributes which were used 
in implementations for each use case. This maybe needs to go into a different document, so it can 
be updated without affecting this standard.

TBD.
